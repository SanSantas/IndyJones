# Indiana Jones and the Golden Idol Heist Simulator

This project was created to demonstrate my proficiency in the basics of C++. 
My favorite aspect of the source code is how the game board is managed as a single pointer 
that points to other allocated arrays of space pointers that each represent a space that is 
randomly assigned on each game load. 

`Space*** array = new Space ** [rows];`

Use Indy's items to get the golden idol without dying.
Includes an intermediately sophisticated GNU makefile.
